The following repository contains 3 files (excluding this README), and 2 folders,namely:
1) Fashion_MNIST.ipynb
2) Fashion_MNIST.html (and the corresponding folder Fashion_MNIST_files)
3) Fashion_MNIST_CNN_Report.pdf
4) Run (folder). A new randomly named sub folder is created each time we run the notebook, in order to save all plots, figures, and results from that run.

Due to the lack of computational power on our personal computers, we decided to make use of Google Colab for the coding aspect of our project since deep learning requires advanced resources. In order to do this, we created a shared Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtL0uarq2CcBpPSwSRPyXAnEtKvoJ58W?usp=sharing) with the necessary files, including the notebook. Within the Google Colab notebook we need to include Google Drive authentication, and the rest of the notebook will only run properly if shared folder was in the same main folder within our Google Drives.

These complications make it difficult to submit a notebook that is ready to run. For this reason we have also exported it as a .html file (along with the respective folder that contains all the images necessary to load the web page) which will allow you to view the entire project without any complications or difficulties.
